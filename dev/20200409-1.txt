Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned: The Myth of the Objective, 2015.
Kenneth O. Stanley and Joel Lehman

- evolution is just survive + reproduce
- there is no objective
- competition is emergent
- selection is a simplification of competition
- can we contrive the environment so that competition is emergent, so that selection is emergent
- we can then just setup the survival and reproduce dynamics and let the survival define selection
- this makes sense for a simulation, but less so for a a simple func opt
- maybe there is something there, or maybe you fall back on explicit selection for "survival"

- i wonder if we can learn a fitness function, or an objective function
- a learned interpretation of the phenotype in the domain
- what would motivate the learning?

Abandoning Objectives: Evolution Through the Search for Novelty Alone
https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/EVCO_a_00025

- search for novelty drives complexity
- objective function may not reward the stepping stones on the way to the solution
- deception
- often overcome with a carefully designed curriculum - lead along the path to the solution
- alife has no goal other than survival and replication
- growth in complexity is passive, it is not selected

- is there a useful metaphor for novelty search?
- fuss is the search for novel fitness scores - interesting

- this paper does cover all the alternates
- fitness objective strongly limits a given search
- niching as a way of avoiding competition in nature, at least with other species
