sniffing around ecology / evolution wikipedia

looking at a number of books on evolution and evolutionary ecology

- Discovering Evolutionary Ecology (2006)
- Ecological-Evolutionary theory (2005)
- Evolutionary ecology (2001)

behavioral ecology looks interesting, e.g. behavior as an adaptive trait, in addition to phenotype

- An introduction to behavioural ecology (2012)

Also general books on evolution:

- What evolution is (2002)

looks great. I might audiobook + paper book it as well.

Some books i want to get but pdf's are not out there:

- Speciation, 2004
- The Ecology of Adaptive Radiation, 2000

The idea of doing a masters in this stuff would be fun, but I don't want to go down to biochemistry. I want to stay up at the systems level.

Also, not sure I want to go down into the marth of ecology and speciation, e.g. this book looks so boring:

- Fitness landscapes and the origin of species (2004)

lots of interesting topics that I want to learn more about
mostly related to:
- speciation
- adaptive radiations

not sure why.

for example, if we develop models of speciation and adaptive radiations in software as a problem solving technique, so what. it's only interesting if it can achieve results that other techniques cannot achieve

perhaps tie back to the idea of open ended evolution

e.g. exploring open ended evolution as a project, or at least ideas on how we might address it before actually diving in

i'd really like a definition of a goal state for open ended evolution.

for example, if the domain was optimization of some kind, what would be considered open ended evolution and what would not be considered open ended evolution?

can we then develop something that achieves the end state?

I can imagine simple base organisms that can be let loose in different domains and adapt to learn to live in those domains. e.g. the same base is a useful starting point for solving a range of problems

it would have to have indirection between raw data and reading mechanism and both data and reading mechanism would have to be subject to evolution. sounds fun.

sounds like multi-task learning with the same base "organism". you can then race different base algorithms to see how well / how quickly they adapt to different problem domains

for me, true open ended evolution / long running evolutionary algorithms should be surprising. it should be able to develop structures that are ever-more exploitative (fit / efficient at being fit).

They call this: the evolution of novelty or a "major transition"

the idea of a sea creatures going on land or a land creature taking to the air is perhaps the leading edge of "surprising". the equivalent in a software simulation could be considered, even allowed for in base designs.

we don't really have systems that can do this, do we?
how fascinating though, if we did.

if this is all interesting, then it would be a good idea to spec small 1-4 week projects to actually create work product, otherwise it will be unbounded research

say
- evolution intro
- speciation
- adaptive radiation
- open ended evolution intro
	- alife perspective
	- biology perspective
- proposed approach to open ended evolution

each could be one week with a report / mono graph as the output (100 page)

a 2d platform game/env test harness would be fun
- e.g. resources that are out of reach that requires novelty / innovation in forms to reach

most species go extinct when challenged
life is tenacious, so even just a few survivors can pull the species back along a new path

this is a fun area.
