- biological anthropology

- animal behavior - ethology

- Speciation

- Niche construction

- rl
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning
	http://rlai.ualberta.ca/

- a site dedicated to metaheuristics would be fun
- lots of algorithms to cover
- easy niche to dominate
- lots of theory to dip into
- no practical application


- it might be fun to set the research agenda of: non-convergent search

- convergence
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence
- convergence, ec
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_(evolutionary_computing)

- i think it is a function of the objective
	- you convergence because the objective is simple and static
- convergence is the right thing to do for a simple problem
- it is the wrong thing to do for an open problem

- GPs
- Genetic Programming IV
- john koza

- open domains like design
	- programs
	- circuits
	- virtual creatures
	- etc.
- domains where GPs are used, not EAs
- domains where RL are used

- non-convergence is divergence
- divergent search

Searching for the Unexpected: Evolution through Surprise
	http://gravinadaniele.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/phd_thesis.pdf

- novelty vs suprise
	- novel is not seen before
	- surprise is unexpected
	- novelty can be surprising or not
	- surprise does not have to be novel

- to my mind, random would be maximumly surprising, in the sense of entropy/information theory

I would love to have a system that can run and give viable solutions, the longer it runs, the more different and better solutions it gives - without end - we would not want to turn it off
