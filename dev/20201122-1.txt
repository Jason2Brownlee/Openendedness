perhaps get some textbooks of evolutionary ecology to ground thinking in science

the book "adaptation to life" is good reading, behavior as a psychological adaptation for an organism (person) in a specific environment (life). need to think more about. this.

idea for a small environment, 2d, like a platform level, explore open evolution for creatures in the environment and encourage different survival strategies

if the environment doesn't change, the organism does not need to change, at least it does not need to adapt.
