I like selecting "open system" or "open-ended evolution" as a research project goal.

- summarize current thinking
- do a suite of experiments
- think about how to go further

Zipf’s Law, unbounded complexity and open-ended evolution
https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2018.0395

the complexity is in the selection mechanism, really the evaluation mechanism
novelty as defined as different to what came before forces the development of complexity
we can tell a story to motivate this
novelty required to move into new ecological niches
even though the prior niches were only visited, not inhabited.
we could reframe the process and allow survival in the prior encountered ecological niches
this is not speciation, really just domain coverage
development of behavior in order to achieve coverage, useful coverage
this is the connection to map elites, useful coverage
it highlights that we don't need to move into population evolution, that we can explore in one domain

academic research and business are models
go where others are not or recombine in ways others are not
useful novelty or useful coverage


Enabling conditions for ‘open-ended evolution’
http://lifecognitionschool.ias-research.net/files/2010/06/Ruiz-Mirazo_etal_BP_2008.pdf

decoupling of phenotype and genotype is probably important
i'd argue that simulation of phenotype as part of evaluation also being important
environment mediated stochastic evaluation

maybe novelty is required because all the other bits are deterministic
maybe if simulation was more stochastic, we could motivate by a different metric and get similar "novelty", e.g. useful coverage of the domain

explosion, intelligence explosion and complexity explosion
these are related concepts, positive feedback

can the story of novelty search be told in other ways leading to alternate implementations
can it be conceived more broadly or alternately

need to adapt perception, e.g. how much of the domain or modalities can be perceived
need variation in env

I think you need the ability for nonlinear mappings at each point in the process
