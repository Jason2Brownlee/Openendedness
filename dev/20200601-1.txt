I could work through textbooks on ec and implement everything
use a simple language like python
use arrays to get some speed
demo everything
make a site that crushes the niche
probably a code base that has examples of everything
probably books on main topics

the risk is that it is all an overlap with mlmastery
that i would get into trouble directly or indirectly, a conflict

might be best to put this project to sleep for 2 years
