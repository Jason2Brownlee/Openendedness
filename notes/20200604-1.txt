evolution as a solution for the problem of survival

- how do you get a thing to survive indefinitely?

evolution as a way to achieve this
has pre-conditions
- properties of the environment
	- limited resources
	- competition
- properties of the individual
	- limited life
	- reproduction
	- copying errors

it may be the most effective solution under these conditions
emergent effects of discovery, adaptation, etc.
selection operates on the emergent effects using the simple underlying processes

not new stuff here, just a better framing for what the process is all about
it is not an optimizer
it is a solution to survival


I like this angle a lot.
