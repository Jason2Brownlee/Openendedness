Evolution: Limited & Predictable or Unbounded & Lawless?
https://www.worldwidewanderings.net/Publications/EvolutionViews.pdf

- novelty search is a type of non-objective search
- are there other types of non-objective search
- there's always an objective, it just means using a different objective than the true goal

Novelty search: a theoretical perspective
https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3321707.3321752

- uniform random search in behavior space
- for behavior space that cannot be sampled directly
	- we cannot sample cakes directly
	- we can sample recipes that create cakes

- efficient search over the reachable behavior space
- uniform sampling of reachable behavior space

- I guess it assumes that the objective function is deceptive
	- applies to some, but not all tasks

- the objective that is used must be aligned with the true objective in some way
- the behaviors elicited bust be appropriate

- it might be fun to explore different objectives for a given simple task, e.g. onemax or func opt

- fitness is relative to where the search has already been in behavior space
- dynamic objective function


Illuminating search spaces by mapping elites
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04909

- illumination search
	- vs optimization
- shift in focus away from the objective and toward sampling behavior space
- all sounds like niching to me

Comparing multimodal optimization and illumination
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317688725_Comparing_multimodal_optimization_and_illumination

niching can do as well


Minimal Criteria Novelty Search (MCNS)
Novelty Search with Local Competition (NSLC)

Quality Diversity: A New Frontier for Evolutionary Computation
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2016.00040/full

- different from niching
- niching balances diversity and quality
- novelty search is only concerned with phenotype diversity

- divergent search algorithms
- requires complex mapping of G to P

- what if we use a neural net to learn a mapping of G to P
- optimize the mapping is the novelty search, and the "task" is a single ga run with the mapping

- quality divergent search re-introduces the objective into behaviors
- multi-objective is one approach
- qd - store best performing behavior for a behavior niche
- e.g. map elites
