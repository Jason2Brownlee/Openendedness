# What does a solution look like?

If a paper came out that stated that it had solved "openendedness", what would it permit?

* What would be possible with openendedness solved that could not be achieved beforehand?
* What would the claim be exactly?
* What would be the evidence used in the paper to support the claim?
* What would prevent the broader community from accepting the claim?
* How would the finding be communicated broadly to the laymen?

This comes back to sharpening up the definition and promise of openendedness.

I guess it would be a system that was capable of generating useful (adaptive) solutions (novelty) perpetually (as long as it was run).

Or something like that.

But randomness clumps. So generated novelty would probably look like punctuated equilibrium. The simulation runs would have to be fast enough (the domains simple enough) that waiting for novelty would be reasonable. Minutes to hours.

Once it can do this, I guess the experts would then come in and classify the types of novelty generated over time and determine whether it fits into preconceived models and formalism.

Perhaps we can focus on a domain that supports sufficiently rich phenotypic novelty and processes that are able to explore it "effectively", better than random search and exhaustive search.

I feel like the search is the easy part. The richness of environment is the hard part. Followed by the richness of the mapping from genotype to phenotype.

Perhaps we can sharpen up these ideas over time as we read more.

A review paper on the question might be required to make the effort systematic.
