thoughts after a podcast on the definition of life, sean carrol mindscape - with stuart bartlet

- theory of evolution is good, but incomplete
- we can simulate the adaptive part
- we cannot get continuious innovation
	- related to open ended evolution
- therefore our understand of evolution must have holes

my thought
- difference between the branches tree of life that show diversity and ones that don't
- is it body plan or something (representation) that facilitates the open extendedness?

this would be a super fun area to dig into
summarize
do independen experiments



there was also some note about the limits of evolution/cooperation - some boundary
I guess i need to do a deep dive into the evolution of evolveability
