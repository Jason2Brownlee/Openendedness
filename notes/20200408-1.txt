- the idea of a 1 year project on open ended evolution and perhaps a monograph in the topic
- sounds fun
- as long as I can run my own experiments


Quality Diversity: A New Frontier for Evolutionary Computation
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2016.00040/full

- are these maze problems so contrived that they don't match the properties of real problems?

- I would need to work toward a problem where open endedness offers a clear benefit
- hacking on some abstract domain would not be long term interesting
