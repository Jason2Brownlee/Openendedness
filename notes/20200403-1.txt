what if I just explored independent research projects

follow curiosity
write up what i learn into a monograph

Whatâ€™s holding artificial life back from open-ended evolution?
https://thewinnower.com/papers/2309-what-s-holding-artificial-life-back-from-open-ended-evolution

might be fun to explore small experiments

niching with a cost function that has noise on a sine wave over time
- e.g. ever changing env and built-in diversity preservation

OEE1 Workshop (Session 1, 20 July 2015) video recording (Part 4/5)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTV7SJUOzzQ&feature=youtu.be&t=22m46s

- what are the barriers to open endedness
- continual change
- continual complexity
- potential
	- change
	- novelty
	- complexity
	- ecological

- vary the environment
- new environments

The evolutionary origin of complex features

- some env for experiments

Illuminating search spaces by mapping elites
https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04909

- nice niching approach

Evolving a diversity of virtual creatures through novelty search and local competition
https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~meeden/cs81/f17/papers/lehman_gecco11.pdf

- diversity within one "env"
- forced, there's no why other than local competition
- perhaps that's all that's needed
- the drive seems insufficient to me

- increases in complexity can lead to increases in novelty
- need unbounded complexity -> unbounded novelty -> open endedness

next?

do i want to do experiments in open endedness
do i want to experiments with novelty search
do i want to experiments with neuroevolution in games
