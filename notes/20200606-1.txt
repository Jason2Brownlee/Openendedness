thoughts while reading the adaptive landscape / innovation book

- explore competition as emergent
- explore bacteria evolution
	- all the useful mechanisms used
- explore the more sophisticated multi-cellular evolution
	- more complex mechanisms
- explore genetic drift
	- more or less impact than selection based on organism size
- explore a brute force solver for bit strings
	- and other

it occurs to me that the process is over simplified
the system does not develop useful mechanisms itself
it is forced to bootstrap in an existing environment with an existing set of mechanisms
no idea if they are appropriate
cannot really do discovery
the mechanisms of evolution must be under evolution as well.


I like the idea if digging into all of this as independent research

It might be a good idea to benchmark a few different implementation approaches
seed is important
also compare to other languages, like compiled languages

also, experiment with code that uses the gpu

I coded a simple ga using vanilla python
it's really slow

i am not the efficient code guy
making the code run fast will be some serious engineering
possible, but work, and not super fun

might be easier to use an existing lib
or switch to compiled language or similar that is just fast by default so i can write clear code instead

next
- try numpy
- try simple speed up tricks
