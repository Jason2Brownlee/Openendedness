- i think all of this could get very boring if there is not a concrete problem to solve

Novelty Search for Neuroevolution!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mxpn95uxS4

- could consider novelty in different spheres
	- genotype space
	- phenotype space
	- objective space
	- behavior space
	- ...
	- all

Targeted Exploration of Search Spaces - Combining Lexicase Selection and Novelty Search
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiuSBq4qfbo

- combine lexicase selection and novelty search evaluation
- great idea
- maybe just focus on behaviors?

Lexicase Selection
https://push-language.hampshire.edu/t/lexicase-selection/90

- about selection based on solutions that do well on specific test cases
- specialists, not generalists

----

what do i think?

- variation in genotypes (process)
- variation in phenotypes (indirect mapping of g to p)
- variation in behaviour (p)
- variation in env
- variation in drawing resources in order to achieve survival+reproduction
	- fitness?
- emergent competition
